The Workbench Project
===

## Introduction

This project is a work in progress. The purpose is to create a web application front-end to manage a simulation project. The basic idea and functionality follows the Sentaurus Workbench, but the architecture is different in significant ways.

The Workbench Project is intended to be a more general purpose, cloud native simulation project management tool. Here are the main goals for the web application front-end:
    - maintain the flow of simulation stages
    - maintain the table of parameter configurations in each stage
    - display the status of the simulations
    - import and export the simulation configuration data
    - communicate with the simulation server


## Demands are welcome

If you have any idea or specific demand, please let me know by opening an issue. 

Urgent demands are prioritized only after you become a patron of the project, or fuck the repo on your own. 
Contact me at yunlong.lian@proton.me for details.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
