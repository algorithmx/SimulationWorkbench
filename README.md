## Introduction

This project is a work in progress. The purpose is to create a web application front-end to manage a simulation project. The basic idea and functionality follows the Sentaurus Workbench, but the architecture is different in significant ways.

The Workbench Project is intended to be a more general purpose, cloud native simulation project management tool. Here are the main goals for the web application front-end:

+ maintain the flow of simulation stages

+ maintain the table of parameter configurations in each stage

+ display the status of the simulations

+ import and export the simulation configuration data

+ communicate with the simulation server

## Demands are welcome
